Ocha
====

A toy programming language interpreter in Rust. I made this for exploring Rust, compiler & interpreter in general, and mostly for fun. Some of the syntaxes and features are inspired by Javascript, Rust and [Lox](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/).

Planned Features
-----
1. Dynamic types
2. First-class function & closure
3. Prototype-based inheritance
4. Generator function
5. VM with custom bytecode instead of tree-walk interpreter
